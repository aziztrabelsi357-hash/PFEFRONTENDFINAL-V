# 🚨 Error Solutions Summary

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. ❌ Route Error: "No routes matched location '/ai-farms'"
**✅ SOLUTION**: 
- Added redirect from `/ai-farms` → `/ai-detection`
- Created new AI Detection Hub at `/ai-detection`

### 2. ❌ Backend Connection Refused (localhost:8080)
**✅ SOLUTION**: 
- Your Spring Boot backend is not running
- Start your backend server to enable authentication and data features
- The AI detection pages will work without backend, but you won't be able to save results

### 3. ❌ Token null (User not authenticated)
**✅ SOLUTION**: 
- User needs to login first
- Navigate to `/login` to authenticate
- AI detection pages require authentication

## 🎯 Available Routes Now:

### Main AI Routes:
- **`/ai-detection`** - AI Detection Hub (main landing page)
- **`/ai-plant-detection`** - Plant detection interface  
- **`/ai-animal-detection`** - Animal detection interface
- **`/ai-farms`** - Redirects to `/ai-detection`

### Your Current URLs:
